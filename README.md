## About the repository
This repository stores my Python practices with techniques mentioned the book, including:
- Forecasting KPIs: Bias, Error, MAD, MAE, MAPE, MSE and RMSE.
- Statistical methods: Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing With Damped Trend, Triple Exponential Smoothing (Multiplicative) With Damped Trend, Triple Exponential Smoothing (Additive) With Damped Trend.
- Outlier cleaning.
- Statistical models optimization for Simple and Double Exponential Smoothing models.
- Machine Learning methods: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-means Clustering, Parameter Optimization with K-Fold Cross-Validation and RandomSearch, etc.
